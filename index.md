# Hello and Welcome


My name is Justin Ma and after working mainly in front end design I've made the switch into a more technical role that is now finding
the balance between Design and Big Data in order to bring the conceptual down to a comprehensive narrative.

Data Science with a focus on NLP, Gaming/Interactive media analytics, and Machine Learning within Big Data.
